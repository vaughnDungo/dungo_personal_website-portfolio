Good morning and happy new year everyone.



Welcome to learning task 1. In this learning task you will be creating your very own personal website. Your website must showcase a bit about yourself and your skills, interests, projects, and achievements. You will apply what you have learned so far about the basics of HTML and CSS, layouting using Flex and Grid, responsive design, and basics of animations and transitions. I encourage everyone to explore, be creative and let your personality shine through.

I also understand that the task may seem daunting so I have compiled a list of resources that you might find useful. I have listed them below. If you find other resources that might be useful, please share them in our Teams.


Here are also a couple of guidelines for the learning task:

Please name your Github repository as <github_username>.github.io (e.g. jjlipat-mcl.github.io).
You may find the grading criteria below.
Please add a README file that discusses the following:

How you accomplished each item in the criteria except for README file discussion
Insights that you have gathered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1)

Struggles that you have encountered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1)
How you could improve your website in the future

Other thoughts that might be noteworthy

Once done, please submit a link to the Github repository containing the code of your personal website.
Make sure that your Github repository is public so I would be able to check it. 


If you have any questions or concerns please do send a message through MS Teams.



Happy coding,

Job

PS: I would avoid cramming this learning task because it might take a couple of days to finish
