Good morning and happy new year everyone.



Welcome to learning task 1. In this learning task you will be creating your very own personal website. Your website must showcase a bit about yourself and your skills, interests, projects, and achievements. You will apply what you have learned so far about the basics of HTML and CSS, layouting using Flex and Grid, responsive design, and basics of animations and transitions. I encourage everyone to explore, be creative and let your personality shine through.

I also understand that the task may seem daunting so I have compiled a list of resources that you might find useful. I have listed them below. If you find other resources that might be useful, please share them in our Teams.


Here are also a couple of guidelines for the learning task:

Please name your Github repository as <github_username>.github.io (e.g. jjlipat-mcl.github.io).
You may find the grading criteria below.
Please add a README file that discusses the following:

How you accomplished each item in the criteria except for README file discussion:

To enhance the responsiveness of the website, I incorporated CSS media queries. These queries allow the website to adapt its layout and styling based on the screen size of the device accessing it. By defining specific styles for different screen widths, I ensured that the content is displayed optimally across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

For the background image in the "main" section, I adjusted its opacity to prevent it from overpowering the foreground content. This was achieved by adding a semi-transparent overlay using CSS. By carefully selecting the opacity value, I maintained the visual appeal of the background while improving the readability of the text on top of it.

To add a subtle animation effect to the navigation bar, I employed CSS transitions. By specifying a transition property and duration on the anchor tags within the navigation list, I created a smooth color change when users hover over the links. This simple animation enhances the interactivity and visual appeal of the navigation.

For smooth scrolling, I utilized JavaScript. By adding a script that intercepts the default behavior of anchor links and smoothly scrolls to the target section, I improved the user experience. This creates a seamless transition between sections when users click on navigation links.

To ensure consistency in typography and spacing, I carefully reviewed and adjusted the CSS styles for different sections. This involved refining font sizes, line heights, and overall spacing to create a cohesive and polished visual appearance throughout the website.

In the "info" section, I added a call-to-action link with a background color and hover effect. This was achieved through CSS styling. The link stands out visually, inviting users to explore more information about the individual. The use of a link also provides an opportunity to create a separate page with additional details.

For the social media icons, I adjusted the spacing and positioning using CSS to ensure better alignment. Additionally, I employed CSS transitions to create a smooth color change on hover. This subtle effect adds a touch of interactivity and visually indicates the active state of the icons.

Regarding the external library (Ionicons), I included it in the HTML file using a script tag with a specific version. This ensures that the icons are displayed correctly on the website. To stay updated, it's important to regularly check for new versions of the library and update the script tag accordingly.

By implementing these changes and enhancements, the website becomes more responsive, visually appealing, and user-friendly, providing a better overall experience for visitors.

How you could improve your website in the future
Other thoughts that might be noteworthy:

"Firstly, considering the responsive design is crucial in today's multi-device environment. Currently, your website seems to lack responsiveness, as the layout may not adapt well to various screen sizes. Implementing media queries in your CSS would ensure that your content is presented in an optimal way on both desktop and mobile devices. This can significantly enhance accessibility and usability.

In terms of design, the background image used in the "main" section is visually appealing, but it might be beneficial to ensure that it doesn't overpower the foreground content. Adjusting the opacity or using a semi-transparent overlay can strike a balance, making the text more readable while maintaining the aesthetic appeal of the background image.

The navigation bar is functional, but a subtle animation or transition effect on hover could add a touch of interactivity and make the navigation more engaging. Additionally, providing smooth scrolling when clicking on navigation links to reach different sections of your page can enhance the overall user experience.

The typography and color scheme are generally good, but consistency in font sizes and spacing could be improved for a more polished look. Ensure that the font size and line-height are consistent across different sections to maintain a cohesive visual style.

In the "info" section, the use of a call-to-action link is excellent, but consider adding more information or creating a separate page where users can delve deeper into your portfolio, projects, or resume. This can provide a more comprehensive view of your skills and experiences.

The social media icons at the bottom are a nice touch, but the spacing and positioning could be refined for better alignment. Consider incorporating tooltips or labels for better clarity on the purpose of each icon.

Lastly, while the use of external libraries like Ionicons is convenient, it's essential to keep them up to date for security and performance reasons. Regularly check for updates and ensure that your website remains compatible with the latest versions.

In summary, by focusing on responsive design, subtle animations, consistent typography, and refining the user interface, your portfolio website can become more engaging and user-friendly. Regular updates and improvements will ensure that your online presence reflects your evolving skills and experiences."

Once done, please submit a link to the Github repository containing the code of your personal website.
Make sure that your Github repository is public so I would be able to check it. 


If you have any questions or concerns please do send a message through MS Teams.



Happy coding,
